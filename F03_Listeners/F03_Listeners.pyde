# TOUR-2 Lets have another look at the keyPressed() method. The documentation
#   at https://processing.org/reference/keyPressed_.html talks about "mouse and
#   keyboard events". An _event_ is some kind of _message_ which is created by
#   a _sender_, transmitted over a _channel_, and received by a _receiver_, or
#   several receivers. This _pattern_ is so common that it has many names, e.g.,
#   - event handling: event source, control -> event handler
#   - publishâ€“subscribe: publisher -> subscriber
#   - observer pattern: subject -> observer, listener
#   In the sequel, I will use the words "sender", "message", and "receiver".

# TOUR-3 When someone presses a mouse button, the OS handles it (more or
#   less) like this: the mouse, as the sender, generates a new message,
#   which is sent to an appropriate listener (most often, the window
#   underneath the mouse position). If the receiver is this sketch
#   (F03_Listeners.pyde), it receives a message with information about
#   - whether or not a mouse button is currently pressed (mousePressed)
#   - which mouse button is pressed, if any (mouseButton)
#   - where the mouse is currently located (mouseX, mouseY)
#   
#   Note that the sender often does not know which, or how many, receivers
#   are listening; however, the sender must create messages which each 
#   receiver can understand; in other words, sender and receiver have to 
#   use a common _protocol_.

# TOUR-4 The same kind of sender/message/receiver mechanism is applied when two 
#   objects of the fisica world touch each other:
#   Here, the message is an object of type FContact, and the receiver is again
#   our program. An FContact message holds several details about the contact:
#   for instance, which two bodies have contact, where the contact happened,
#   at which velocity, and so on. See all the details at
#   http://www.ricardmarxer.com/fisica/reference/fisica/FContact.html
